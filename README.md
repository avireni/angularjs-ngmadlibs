# AngularJS Mad Libs app


ngmadlibs is a Mad Libs game app built with AngularJS, Bootstrap 3.5, HTML5 & CSS3. User is prompted to supply keywords of their choice, a name, job title, tedious task etc. After making the choices, they are plugged into presets, paragraph-long text that has blanks which are filled in with the user's choices.

This app is primarily built on the AngularJS Templates and Databinding features. It has two views. When the user first visits the page, they'll interact with an interface for inputting the words for the Mad Lib.
When the user clicks the button, the app validates that the user has provided values in each of the input fields, and if so, this part of the interface is hidden, and the second part of interface is presented, with the words the user has selected appropriately displayed.
